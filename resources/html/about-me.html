                        <h2> About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi! I would like to first to introduce myself, I am Michael Mount. I am curretnly a 24 year student enrolled in the DU
                full-stack web devlopment program! I have grauated from the University of Northern Colorado with a Bacholors in Preforming Arts
                and Theatre Studies. I have owned my own photogrphy business for over 3 years now and have done everything from wedding photography,
                cosplay and faimly potraits. Next to photography, i've spent a majority of my life in the world of preforming arts! Which might lead you
                wonder why I might be starting a carrer in coding. Since I was young I have loved working with computers. Even starting with building my first PC 
                in middle school. During my young life, I was self-teching and starting to learn coding with java and javascript. I never got too far into 
                coding at this time as preforming arts becoming a main focus during my time at university. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                Unfortutly, like most, my plan was dereailed by the 2020 pandemic. Graduating directly into the new closed off world, my options became 
                very limited and I had to set sail on a new line of work to get through the tough times. It was at this moment in time that I started working 
                with my computer again and rediscovred my younger passion for computers and the many diffrent languages to talk to them! I have been self-taught 
                in coding for a couple months and decided to take a career path into the world of web devlopment as I can to relize it was something I love to do.
                Now curretly enrolled in the Denver University Full-stack felx program I am underway into starting an enriching career path into the world of 
                web development!
